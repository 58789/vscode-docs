## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.35 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/89?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Extension authoring

### Splitting `vscode` package into `@types/vscode` and vscode-test

During the [`event-stream` incident](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/11/26/event-stream) last year, we found that `vscode` package was affected as it pulls in 223 transitive dependencies totaling to 16MB. From time to time, these dependencies also cause GitHub security alerts for all extensions. Since then, we started slimming down `vscode`.

`vscode` package today serves two purposes:
- Pull `vscode.d.ts` for extension development
- Run integration test by downloading and launching a local copy of VS Code

So we split `vscode` into `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`, two packages with more focused functionality.

- [`@types/vscode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/vscode) contains `vscode.d.ts` for each release. For example, `npm i @types/vscode@1.34.0` installs VS Code 1.34 Extension API.
- [`vscode-test`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-test) provides a set of API to run integration test with VS Code. You can learn more about using it in the [Testing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extensionc) page.

The old `vscode` package will continue to work, but new features will go to `vscode-test`. We suggest that you switch over to `vscode-test` which features slimmer dependency graph and a more flexible, explicitly documented API.

Additionally:

- [`vscode-dts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) allows you to to quickly download any version of VS Code API in CLI
- [`vsce`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-vsce) now checks `@types/vscode` version against `engines.vscode` to prevent you from using new API incompatible with old versions of VS Code
- [`helloworld-test-sample`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/helloworld-test-sample), [Testing Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension) page and [Continuous Integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration) page are updated to use `vscode-test`
- [VS Code Extension Generator](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code) now scaffolds extensions using `@types/vscode` and `vscode-test`
